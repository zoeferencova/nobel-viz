# Visualizing the Nobel Prize

Interactive data visualization with filters, two bar charts, a map component, and an info box component. The filters and charts allow the user to explore various trends in historical Nobel prize winners. The info box component provides details on the individual winners, using information scraped from their Wikipedia pages.

The data was scraped using Scrapy and processed using NumPy and pandas and visualizations were made using D3.js.

The project was created with guidance from the wonderful book, [Data Visualization with Python and JavaScript](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/data-visualization-with/9781098111861/), by Kyran Dale.
